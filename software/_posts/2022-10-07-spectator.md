I often see developers getting caught up in the cycle of watching endless amounts of tutorials online and not doing any actual programming. While doing it, it might feel like you are accomplishing something and sometimes you do but that is a very small portion of what is needed to become a proficient developer. 

Courses are good in the beginning and it can be useful in specific circumstances especially if you are a visual learner, but you will reach a point of diminishing returns. No matter how many courses you watch you will have to get your hands dirty at some point  and often time early too in your learning process. 

There are also problems with courses that need to be addressed such as poor teaching style, incoherent messaging, insufficient depth of information and other stuff which can definitely waste a new developer's time if not kept in check. You will have to do research at some point and oftentimes a good amount in order to circumvent the complexity and subtle nuances that comes with programming. 

## Project based learning?

Project based learning in my opinion even though itâ€™s going to be challenging will test the limits of your knowledge and will push way above any course that will teach you to build a stripped down todo list application. That is the approach that really pushed me after months of dabbling in courses in which I saw minimal improvement in my coding proficiency. 

When you build a project that pushes you beyond your current scope, it forces you to research in the wild and gather information from a lot of talented developers on the internet who are kind enough to share their information. It also forces you to actually read documentation and learn  new things that you will never learn in a course. The benefits far outweighs the process which oftentimes is not easy but is necessary in order to become a proficient developer.
