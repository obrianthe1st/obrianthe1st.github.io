I often see developers getting caught up in the cycle of watching endless amounts of tutorials online and not doing any actual programming. While doing it, it might feel like you are accomplishing something and sometimes you do but that is a very small portion of what is needed to become a proficient developer. 

Courses are good in the beginning and it can be useful in specific circumstances especially if you are a visual learner, but you will reach a point of diminishing returns. No matter how many courses you watch you will have to get your hands dirty at some point  and often time early too in your learning process. 

There are also problems with courses that need to be addressed such as poor teaching style, incoherent messaging, insufficient depth of information and other stuff which can definitely waste a new developer's time if not kept in check. You will have to do research at some point and oftentimes a good amount in order to circumvent the complexity and subtle nuances that comes with programming.
